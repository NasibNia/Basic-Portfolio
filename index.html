                    <p id="tag1">Welcome to my page!</p>
                    <p>My name is <span id="tag1">Nasib</id></span>, Founder and CEO of <span id="tag1">“Keep Nasib Happy!”</id></span> An early stage, yet scalable and highly profitable, imaginary private company that has massively grawn in size and areas of expertise during the last couple of months. “Keep Nasib Happy” offers individual analysis and personal trainings and provides constant and enormous support to  its very own client which is  myself! (surprise surprise!)
                    </p>
                    <p>Shout out to the  efforts and sleepless nights of this company, I was able to deeply dig into my soul and add missing values, meanings and colors to my journey of  life. And, for the last couple of months have been able to take  the beautiful  path of consciously living my everyday  as if it is my last. </p>  
                    <p>
                        Here are bunch of realizations and goals that “Keep Nasib Happy” has made for me and I must or at least try to respect them on a daily basis.
                        <ul>
                            <li><p>
                                    I need to simply get my hands dirty and create new things; I just do! whether it is an intimate dance with the colors on a painting pallet, or flirting with a piece of simple code that introduces beautiful, stunning, new products to the world. My soul feeds off it and needs to explore and get drunk on it. I have never enjoyed settling down and it's just not my personality. My soul needs to feel the true liberation by learning  totally new things. Or will literally die of boredom, otherwise.
                            </p></li>  
                            <li><p>
                                    In this age of internet, social media, easy access and constant distraction,  I need to learn being focused and respectful of my time. Need to prioritize my daily activities  and say “Yes” only to the things that extremely excite me or add a meaningful value to my soul or life.  The choice is clear; It’s either “NO” or “HELL YESSS!” 
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p>
                                    I need to do a bit of meditation on a daily basis, be aware of my mind and thoughts, and exercise the muscle of making peace with the world.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p>
                                    I need to simply be grateful for all the precious  things that world has offered me, the health, the loving family, great people that I have been lucky enough to meet and grow among,  the long path that I went through to get to this moment  and all the little achievements that I made along the way. Being grateful and consciously saying it outload is an instant injection of happiness hormon to my brain.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p>
                                    No ego is welcome to my world; Ego is a quick form of self-fooling. It closes the doors of communication with the world, and kills the learning opportunities,  which is itself a direct path to unhappiness.
                            </p></li>
                            <li><p>
                                    The last, but not the least: I need to simply laugh and be happy!
                            </p></li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                            And this is not all. I am dedicated to improve this list, explore the life, learn and learn and learn, and be grateful for every little thing.
                    </p>
                    <p id="tag2">Make me laugh, teach me something new, help me learn true peace with the world,  and win a position in my imaginary first-class company!</p>
